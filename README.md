Hello! Welcome to the GOC site. This is a message for content creators to make using this site easier.

Changing the front page header image:
The header image is managed through the Header Image image-block in the header region. Go ahead change the file in the settings
for the image-block. DO NOT EDIT THE BODY as it maintains the transparent GOC logo.

Changing project images:
The project images are set in each object of the project content type. Change them, and the changes will be reflected in the
tiles and in the header image of the project page. The highlight tile section utilizes views, so it will display the 6 most 
recently created projects. The tiles are sorted by the date they were created, in descending order.

Linking the "Submit Research Prop" button:
The button is its own self contained block, so to add a link, add an <a href="your link here></a> surrounding the button body
in the block.

The "Give/Donne" page:
This page has not yet been created, as it did not exist in the old site. Please rectify.
