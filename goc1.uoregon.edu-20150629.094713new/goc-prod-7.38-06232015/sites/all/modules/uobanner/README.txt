The purpose of this module is to help standardize (the really one standard feature) all UO websites share, the top UO Banner. 
This allows users to select from the three UO Banner styles put out by UO Web Communications (black, green, and green bevelled).
It also supports fixed width and fluid width banners.

This module also replaces the default Drupal favicon with a UO themed favicon. To use the UO favicon, edit your theme settings 
(Appearance > Settings) to disable the default favicon, but do not specify a replacement, as the module will add the UO logo 
automatically.
